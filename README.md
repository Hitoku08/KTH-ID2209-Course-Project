# KTH-ID2209-Course-Project

## **Project Overview**  
This project is developed as part of the **Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents** course at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**. The main objective is to simulate the behavior and interactions of different types of agents in various environments. The project also includes a **BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agent** implementation to enhance the decision-making capability of the agents.

## **Features**  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Five different agent types**:  
  - Party  
  - Introverted  
  - Observer  
  - Meat Eater  
  - Vegan Eater  
- 🏠 **Two different environments**:  
  - Bar  
  - Concert  
- 🎭 **Three personality traits that affect interaction rules**:  
  - Sociability  
  - Generosity  
  - Tolerance  
- 🧠 **BDI Agent Implementation**:  
  - Agents have **Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions**.  
  - They perceive the environment and make decisions accordingly.  
- 🔄 **Continuous simulation with at least 50 agents**.  
- 📊 **Visualization & Analysis**:  
  - Monitored an **interesting global variable** (e.g., happiness level).  
  - Created **informative graphs** to display behavioral changes over time.  
- 📡 **Communication between agents using FIPA messaging protocol**.
